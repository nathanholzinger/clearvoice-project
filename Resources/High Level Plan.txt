PRIORITIES:
1. feature complete
2. bug free
3. pretty up UI
4. clean up code / better utilize Angular/MVC organization if you didn't do that well the first time
5. more bug testing
6. prettier UI
7. add extra features if time allows

HIGH HIGH LEVEL PLAN:
- Allow user to log in to Twitter.
- Pull tweets
- Count words by most commonly used
- Remove articles/prepositions/pronouns/other very common words to leave only "keywords"
- Give each remaining word a rank value (RV)
- Create searches to query Flickr, there will be 31 total, loop through searches:
    - consider modifying RV with RNG to add variability
    - use top 3 keywords for search based on RV. in case of tie, choose randomly.
    - make sure search returns at least 1 image that isn't already in collage, if not:
        - use top 2 key words, if not use top key word, if not remove top keyword as invalid and use new top 3 keywords
    - modify all key words used in search to lower their value to allow other keywords to surface to top
	- (formula should allow highly common words to stay near the top for a few searches before they get buried)
- Once searches are done and images are pulled prepare the images for the collage
    - collage will be 5x5 grid (25 squares total, each square in grid ~160px)
    - scale/crop top 3 images to 2x2 (12 squares total)
    - scale crop next 8 images to 1x1 (8 squares total)
    - scale crop next 20 images to .5x.5 (place 4 images to a square, 5 squares total)
- place images randomly into grid, display collage as seperate images placed directly next to eachother.
    - image sizes make it impossible to get "stuck" and not be able to fit an image somewhere. (it is impossible to place 2 2x2 squares into a 5x5 grid in such a way that a 3rd 2x2 square can't fit somewhere. also, after all 3 2x2 squares have been placed everything else fits into a single square)

IF TIME ALLOWS:
- let user log into Facebook, Google+, etc instead of twitter
- improve grid formula to allow more variety in square sizes. this will be much more complex because you'll have to make sure all images fit within the grid
- figure out how to properly merge seperate images into a single image
